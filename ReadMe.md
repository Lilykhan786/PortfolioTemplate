<h1 align="center">Portfolio Website Template</h1>

This is a simple responsive portfolio website template that I made for [Repl.it](https://repl.it) [template jam](https://repl.it/talk/templates/Portfolio-Site-Template/37272). You can use it and make it yours by changing things and colors to your style and liking! I made it with a lot of hard work, love and of course with code :) I'm not a professional coder, but i tried my best to make it look cool and yet still keep it simple. While working with JS i got many errors, but thanks to [Kakashi](https://repl.it/@apoorvsingal) for fixing them. Also thanks to all people on discord who provided feedback and suggestions, especially Panda and Kub! :D

> Mistakes are proof that we are trying!

I learned so much while making this template, if you use it, please let me know. I would love to see how amazing people can make it! I hope you'll like it!

## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons 
+ **Unsplash** for Images

You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it.
Feel free to contribute to the code _but please do not steal the code and post it everywhere as your work and if you want to use the template don't forget to give the credit._  Have a nice day! :D
